# CV

## Personal Summary

I was born and raised in Japan. 
I'm curious about working with people who have various nationalities and cultures. 
Though them, I believe that I can realize my own identities.

I'm usually an calm person. As a professional, I cherish keeping my motivation.

In terms of programming, also I love to find an abstract way to think.
For example, the way to write a readable and resusable code, the new discovery on the business domain.
This is why I love programming.

In the end, I love third wave coffee, impressionism arts and alternative/indie band's songs.
